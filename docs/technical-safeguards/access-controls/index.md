The **Security Rule** under HIPAA defines **access** as the ability to view, change, or use information or systems. This rule specifies how access to Electronic Protected Health Information (EPHI) should be managed and controlled.

### Key Points:

1. **Access Controls**: These are the rules that decide who can access information systems or data and what they can do with it (view, edit, delete, etc.). Only authorized people should have access, and they should only have access to the minimum information necessary to do their job.
2. **Access Management**: Covered entities (like healthcare organizations) must implement policies and procedures to ensure that only the right people or programs can access electronic health information.
3. **Access Control Methods**: There’s no one-size-fits-all method for controlling access, but the organization must choose appropriate tools or systems to implement these controls. These tools should align with the role of the person accessing the information. For example, an administrator might have access to system settings, but only specific data related to their role.
4. **Four Requirements for Access Control**:
    - **Unique User Identification (Required)**: Each user must have a unique ID to track their access to sensitive information.
    - **Emergency Access Procedure (Required)**: There must be a plan for how to grant access in case of emergencies, ensuring the right people can still access information when needed.
    - **Automatic Logoff (Addressable)**: If a user’s session is idle for too long, the system should automatically log them off. (This is not mandatory but strongly recommended.)
    - **Encryption and Decryption (Addressable)**: Data should be encrypted when stored or transmitted, though it’s not required in all cases, it’s a good practice to protect sensitive information.
